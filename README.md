# 🚀 Task 0: Installing Necessary Tools for MERN Stack Development

Welcome to the first step of your MERN stack journey!

In this task, we’ll set up the development environment by installing all the essential tools required to build full-stack applications using the **MERN** stack.

---

## 📚 What is the MERN Stack?

**MERN** is a popular tech stack used for full-stack web development. It includes:

- **M**: MongoDB – NoSQL database
- **E**: Express.js – Backend web framework running on Node.js
- **R**: React.js – Frontend library for building user interfaces
- **N**: Node.js – JavaScript runtime for server-side programming

We'll use this stack to build the **ETSA Website**. Before jumping into coding, we need to prepare our development tools.

## 🌐 Web Development: Quick Overview

Every web application has two main parts:

### ✅ Frontend:
- The part users **see and interact with** (UI)
- Built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React**

### ✅ Backend:
- The part that **processes requests, interacts with databases**, and returns results
- Built using **Node.js, Express.js**, and connected to a database like MongoDB

## 🛠 Tools You Need to Install

---
### ✅ 1. VScode (Hope you have it.)
### ✅ 2. Node.js (includes npm – Node Package Manager)
Install yourself or follow nodeinstall.md file
### ✅ 3. git (version control software -> helps managing your code)
Install yourseld or follow gitinstall.md file
### ✅ 4. Go make a github account( You are a Devloper from Nov onwards)


## Link Git with GitHub
open a terminal and add your github details
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"


##🧪Verify Installation (Node, Git, npm)

Now that you've installed Node.js, Git, and configured GitHub, let's verify your setup by running a script that checks and logs the versions.

---

## ✅ Instructions

### Step 1:Fork and Clone the Repository(Follow an yt video if you don't understand forking and cloning repository)

In your terminal, navigate to where you want to store the project folder, then run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-org-or-username>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>/task0

### Step 2:Run the Verification Script
```bash
node check-setup.js

output: it will create a file name setup-status.txt

### Step 3:Commit and Push Your Results(you can always use yt and GPT)
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "02-09-2025: Aryan Theng(This is just a commit msg you can write anything)"
git push

### Step 4:Create a PR(Pull request from GitHub)
Go to the repo on github and make a pull request(PR) and wait until it get merged.
If you have made a PR you can DM me to get it merged quickly.

### Step 5:Now, if you see a file of your name in output folder on this link().
🎉 Congrats! You have successfully completed your environment setup.
🚀 You are no longer a beginner — welcome to real-world development!
